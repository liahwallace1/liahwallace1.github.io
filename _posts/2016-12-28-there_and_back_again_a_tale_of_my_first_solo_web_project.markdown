I recently finished the HTML and CSS lessons on Learn.co, and I felt like I needed some practice before moving on. I decided to create a personal website that I can use as a resume when I start my job hunt. Spoiler Alert: I didn't finish it. I blame this partly on a huge mistake I made! I knew I needed to practice my HTML and CSS skills, but I didn't really think about (or research, or look back at the Web Fundamentals lessons for) the right steps to plan a website before I just started writing the code. So in this blog, I'll look at the steps I took in creating my website, and how I would do it better next time. 

The steps I took creating my site were very convoluted, and included a lot of procrastinating on social media. I drew this picture to sum it up:

As you can see, lack of planning resulting in so much wasted time! I think if I had a plan ahead of time, I would have had more success even though I am new to HTML and CSS. Here is what I would do next time:

1) **Research and Inspiration:**
       This is the only step I would keep the same. I'm also new to designing a website, so the web is a great place to see design elements other people are using. 
			 
2) **Set your objectives and goals:**
       Think about your target audience. For my site, this will hopefully be employers or people I am networking with. I want an eye-catching, but easy to navigate and informative site that will show off my skills and my personality. 
			 
3) **Create a sitemap:**
       What different sites or sections do you want on your site and how will they link together? In the end, I decided to go with a sleek one page site with div IDs for the different sections I wanted: Profile, Experience, Skills, Portfolio, Personal Info, Contact Information. My nav bar links to the div IDs so a user can scroll through the entire page or just skill to the content they are interested in. 
			 
4) **Create a site mock up:**
      Whether you create a hand drawn mock up or a digital mock up (with applications like Balsamiq and Mockingbird) this will help you visualize your site and how you want to layout your content. Don't forget to think about how you would want a mobile version of your site to look! You should think about responsive design in this step, so you might decide if you want to use Bootstrap or create your styles from scratch.
			
5) **File Organization and Versioning:**
      Before you start writing your code, set up your file structure and initialize a local and remote GitHub repository. You will probably need folders for your CSS stylesheets, Javascript,  Fonts, and Images. You can also create your index.html file for your home page. Make sure you commit changes to GitHub as you go!
			
6) **Plan your content:**
      Planning your content isn't just writing the text. This could include images, documents, audio, video, Adobe Flash files, Content feeds from other websites, photos, a Twitter stream, Facebook content, RSS feeds. What does your site need, where will you get the content, how is it best displayed? 
			
7) **Research code for major design elements:**
      If you are new to HTML and CSS like I am, it would be useful to research the best way to create and style your major design elements before you start coding, and have your resources already handy when you come to writing that code. Especially if you are using Bootstrap, you can research Components like a Jumbotron, nav bar, scroll spy, and buttons ahead of time. 
			
8) **Finally start coding!:**
      Now that you have a clear outline of your site, your content planned, and your resources by your side, it will be so much easier to write your code! Hopefully, you won't have to go back and forth a million times like I did! 
			

Unfortunately, I didn't finish my personal site yet, but I think I have a good start and I learned a valuable lesson. Just because you are working on your own, does not mean that you can forego the planning stage. Next time around, I will follow these steps.
