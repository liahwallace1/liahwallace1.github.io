I'm 30. I've been working in a career for a while. I have a Masters in Environmental Studies that I'm not putting to good use. Why move away from those skills to start learning something new and challenging? 

The only real answer is that I am a Dreamer. I've been in the professional world long enough to know that many people settle. They find themselves a pretty good job - they don't love it, it's not fulfilling, they don't get enough vacation, but it's easier to stay than to move on to something new. I've been that person. But then I saw a high school friend's pictures of his time in Laos. 

This friend had been in the same position as me. He had a pretty good job, he was making good money, but he didn't have the life he wanted. He taught himself to code and hit the road. Travelling for long stints and building a mobile income through freelance web development. I was hooked on that dream. I started the search, and through the internet, I found a slew of amazing blogs written by people that inspired me and showed me this life was possible.   

I still like to be a little practical though! To be able to see the world and experience long term travel, I need a mobile income. There are many ways to make money, but like my friend, I started learning to code and decided web development was the right path for me. It's a skill that can provide the freedom I crave through a remote work environment and that I can grow indefinitely to have a career I can love and be proud of. 

I'm already hooked on the FlatIron School lessons, and I'm excited to work on coding everyday. It can be a little daunting to see the huge amount on knowledge ahead of me, but I like knowing that my career in the tech world will never be static. There is always more to learn - and that's a journey I'm ready take.
